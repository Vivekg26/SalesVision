"My project primarily utilizes the MERN stackâ€”React for the frontend, Node.js for the main backend functionalities, and MongoDB for the database. Additionally, I've integrated Flask, a Python-based framework, to handle specific backend services. Therefore, it's a project that combines the strengths of the MERN stack with Flask for certain backend functionalities."
